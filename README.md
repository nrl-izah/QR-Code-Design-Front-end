## My process

### Built with

- VS Code

### What I learned

```html (I just learned how to make separate stylesheet)
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
```

```css (horizontally and vertically centered)
.white-content {
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 15px;
  padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  margin-right: -50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development

After completing this challenge, I realised there are a lot of areas I need to improve especially in CSS. To be honest, I really jumped into this challenge with probably 10% of what you call basic knowledge. I literally just learned HTML and CSS for an hour yesterday (today, I did this). In conclusion, I need to experiment a lot with properties and understand them as a whole.
